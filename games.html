            <h2>Overwatch 2:</h2>
            <p class="text">Overwatch 2 is a 5v5 “Hero Shooter”, full of different playable characters, each with their own unique abilities, mechanics, etc. Each team can
                 only have one of each hero active at any given time. Competitive Overwatch 2 games are played across four different modes: Hybrid (Combination of Assault 
                 and Escort.  Attacking team must first battle the defenders to win control of an objective point where a payload sits. Once the point is taken, the payload
                 becomes activated, and attackers must escort it to the delivery point at the other end of the map.), Control (Both teams fight to capture a single objective),
                 Escort (Attackers escort a payload while defenders try to stop their progress), Push (teams fight over control of a robot in an effort to escort it as it pushes
                 your team’s barricade to the delivery point.).  Each game mode ends when Attackers accomplish their objective OR Defenders hold off until the game timer reaches 
                 zero.  Also, each hero has unique weapons and abilities suited for various situations.  Heroes are separated into three distinct categories: Damage heroes seek 
                 out to engage and defeat opponents using their various tools and abilities. It is the duty of a damage hero to secure eliminations, Support players empower their
                 allies by healing, boosting damage, or providing vital utility. These heroes are essential to a team’s survival,Tanks soak up damage, create space for the team, 
                 and break apart fortified positions. Heroes in the tank category will lead the charge.  Along with each hero comes multiple abilities. These are defined in three
                 ways: Active (needs to cool down between uses. Average 2 per hero), Passive (unique, inherent abilities/perks that do not need to be activated),Ultimate (powerful
                 abilities; charge them by healing allies or dealing damage). </p>

            <h2>Chess:</h2>
            <p class="text">Chess is a board game played between two players that simulates a war between two kingdoms. It is one of the most popular games in the world. Millions of
                 people play it both recreationally and competitively. PAWNS-Pawns move up the board one square unless it's the first time they're moving when they may move two squares. 
                 Note that they cannot move backward.  The pawn captures pieces one square diagonally and is the only chess piece that captures differently than the way it moves. 
                 It is also the only piece that can capture using the special en passant rule, discussed below.  KNIGHT-The knight moves two squares horizontally and one vertically, or two 
                 squares vertically and one horizontally. The way the knight moves resembles the upper-case "L." Knights capture by landing on top of a piece and are the only pieces 
                 that can jump over others.  BISHOP-The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally. Because of how it moves, the bishop can never step on squares of another color than 
                 the one it started on. Players start the game with two bishops, a light-squared and a dark-squared one.  ROOK-The rook can move any number of squares vertically or horizontally. 
                 Rooks are also the only piece that, together with the king, can castle (discussed below).  QUEEN-The queen is the most powerful piece on the board. It can move diagonally, horizontally, 
                 or vertically as many squares as it wants (unless another piece blocks it).  KING-The king can move one square in every direction. As stated above, the king can make use of the special 
                 castling rule together with a rook.  Check And Checkmate-When a player's king is under the attack of an enemy piece, the king is in check. The player whose king is under attack needs to 
                 protect the king with one of their pieces, move the king out of the attacker's range, or capture the piece attacking their king. If the attacked player can't do any of those, the king 
                 is in checkmate (also shortened as "mate") and they lose the game.</p>
